## **📌 Kaggle: Intro to Machine Learning - Exercise Solutions**  

### **📖 Overview**  
This repository contains my solutions to the **"Intro to Machine Learning"** course from **Kaggle**. The course covers fundamental machine learning concepts, including model selection, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation.  

Each solution is provided in a well-structured Jupyter Notebook or Python script format.  

---

### **📂 Course Content & Solutions**  
Below is a breakdown of the tasks covered in the course, along with my solutions:  

✅ **1. How Models Work**  
- Understanding ML models and how they make predictions.  
- Basic implementation of `DecisionTreeRegressor`.  

✅ **2. Basic Data Exploration**  
- Loading and exploring datasets using `pandas`.  
- Computing statistics like mean, median, and missing values.  

✅ **3. Your First Machine Learning Model**  
- Selecting features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).  
- Training a simple **Decision Tree model** and making predictions.  

✅ **4. Model Validation**  
- Splitting data into **training** and **validation** sets.  
- Evaluating model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.  

✅ **5. Underfitting and Overfitting**  
- Understanding the impact of tree depth on model performance.  
- Experimenting with different `max_leaf_nodes` to optimize the model.  

✅ **6. Random Forests**  
- Implementing and evaluating a **Random Forest model**.  
- Comparing **Decision Tree vs. Random Forest** performance.  

✅ **7. Machine Learning Competitions**  
- Understanding how to participate in Kaggle competitions.  
- Submitting predictions to a competition (e.g., Housing Prices).  
- Using competitions to improve model performance and compare with peers.
